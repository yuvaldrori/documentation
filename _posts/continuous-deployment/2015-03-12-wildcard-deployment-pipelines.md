Get more flexible deployment workflows with wildcard deployment pipelines that trigger if a branch starts with a certain prefix.

Use one deployment configuration for multiple branches and automatically deploy your feature, release, QA, etc. branches to the corresponding environments.

## Static Branch Deployment Pipelines

If you choose _Branch is exactly_ the branch name will need to match exactly the branch that is currently being tested for the deployment to be triggered.

## Wildcard Branch Deployment Pipelines

When you add a new branch to be deployed you can choose whether you are specifying an exact branch name or if this is a **wildcard deployment**. For the latter select _Branch starts with_ from the dropdown and then specify the common part of the branches you want to deploy.

If, for example you want to deploy all branches starting with `feature/` to your staging environment you could add this as the branch name and the deployment would be triggered for any of the following branch names

* feature/wildcard-deployments
* feature/feature-b

But not for _feature-a_, as it is missing the _/_ at the end of `feature/`.

See the following screenshot for a comparison of a configured wildcard deployment pipeline (for _feature/_) to a static branch deployment pipeline (for _master_).
