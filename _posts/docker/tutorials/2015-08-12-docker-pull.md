## Using private images in your builds

`jet` does support using private Docker images as base images for your containers. Similar to [pushing images]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url docker/tutorials/2015-07-03-docker-push %}) you need to save your encrypted `.dockercfg` file in the repository and reference it for any step using private base images (or for groups of steps).

## Configuring a build with a private base image

* Get the AES encryption key from the _General_ settings page of your Codeship project and save it to your repository as `codeship.aes` (adding it to the `.gitignore` file is a good idea).

* For Docker Hub, login locally and mv the credentials file to your repository.

```bash
docker login
# follow the onscreen instructions
# ...
jet encrypt ${HOME}/.docker/config.json dockercfg.encrypted
# or (depending if you are on an older version of Docker)
jet encrypt ${HOME}/.dockercfg dockercfg.encrypted
```

* For Quay.io

    * First configure a [robot account](http://docs.quay.io/glossary/robot-accounts.html)
    * Once you have configured the robot account, download the `.dockercfg` file for this account, by heading over to the _Robots Account_ tab in your settings, clicking the gear icon, selecting _View Credentials_ and hitting the download button.
    * Save the file as `dockercfg` in your repository, encrypt it and add the unencrypted version to `.gitignore`

```bash
echo "dockercfg" >> .gitignore
jet encrypt dockercfg dockercfg.encrypted
```

* Commit `dockercfg.encrypted` as well as the `.gitignore` file

```bash
git add dockercfg.encrypted .gitignore
git commit -m "Adding encrpyted credentials for docker push"
```

* Adapt your Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM codeship/private_base
# ...
```

* Configure your `codeship-services.yml` file. It will probably look similar to the following:

```yaml
# Building a container based on a private base image
app:
  build:
    dockerfile_path: Dockerfile

# pulling a container from a private repository (without building it locally)
db:
  image: codeship/postgresql
```

* Configure your `codeship-steps.yml` file. Make sure to specify the encrypted Docker configuration for any step that requires access to a private image.

```yaml
- service: app
  command: /bin/true
  encrypted_dockercfg_path: dockercfg.encrypted
```

* Commit and push the changes to your remote repository, head over to [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) and watch your build pull the private image from the registry!

As always, feel free to contact [support@codeship.com](mailto:support@codeship.com) if you have any questions.
