We set the `GOPATH` to `${HOME}` and checkout your code into

```shell
${HOME}/src/github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

## Version

We have Go 1.4 installed by default in our virtual machine.
To change to another Go version, add this [script](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/languages/go.sh) in your Setup Commands.

## Dependency management

You can install dependencies with:

```shell
go get
```

To also install test dependencies, use the following command instead

```shell
go get -t -v ./...
```

## Testing

You can run your tests with:

```shell
go test -v
```

You can of course use different test frameworks as well, for example gocheck

```shell
go get launchpad.net/gocheck
go test -gocheck.v
```

## Build

You can build your Go project with

```shell
go build
```
