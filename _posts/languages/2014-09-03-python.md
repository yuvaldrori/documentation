We use **virtualenv** to manage python environments for you. We currently support Python `2.7.6`. Version `3.4.0` of Python is installed as well and available via the `python3` binary.

## Dependencies
You can use pip to install any dependencies, for example

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Python 3
As the virtual environment from `${HOME}/.virtualenv` is already activated and configured for use on the build VMs, if you want to switch to version 3, simply add the following commands to your _Setup Steps_.

```shell
rm -rf ${HOME}/.virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3) "${HOME}/.virtualenv"
```
