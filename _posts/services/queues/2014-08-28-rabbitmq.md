RabbitMQ `3.2.4` runs on the default port and doesn't require any credentials.

We do have the `rabbitmq_management` plugin enabled, which allows for changing various server related settings. Please take a look at the plugin documentation available at [https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) for more information.
