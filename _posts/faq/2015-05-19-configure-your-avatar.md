To change the avatar shown on Codeship, please head over to [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/) and setup an avatar for both, the email address you configured in your Codeship [User Settings](https://codeship.com/user/edit) as well as for any email addresses you use in your git configuration.

You can check the latter via running the following command in a your local git checkout.

```shell
# global configuration
git config --global --get user.email

# project specific (local) configuration
git config --get user.email
```

Note that different projects can have different email addresses configured and that GitHub / BitBucket can have still other email addresses configured for the actions you take via their interfaces.
